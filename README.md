# Space-Game
This is a space game made using C++, in which rockets fly to collect points by hitting other rockets, collect money, health and other powerups.
There is also a fuel gauge, which keeps track of fuel consumed, and if fuel powerup is collected, the fuel gauge gets updated accordinglyy.
The project also features a mini-map which displays the location of the user as well as that of other rockets and power-ups.
